Somewhat like POE::Component::OpenSSH, SSH::Batch, Net::OpenSSH::Parallel etc, but:

 - It is asynchonous, and non-blocking (it uses the AnyEvent and Coro frameworks).

 - It aims to support sudoing smoothly

I tried and failed to achieve parallel ssh with the the ability to
sudo using the above tools.  Aditionally, so far I know there are no
other parallel ssh-invoking tools based on AnyEvent.

It is work in progress. Works for me so far, but expect rough edges.

Feedback appreciated.

See script/gofer for a working, hopefully usable example.
